# CS245 Final Project - Extending EVA

This repo contains the modified source code of the original _Visual Pivoting for (Unsupervised) Entity Alignment_ and various Jupyter Notebooks we used for the experimental setup.

## Table of Contents
- `eva_gridsearch.ipynb`: A grid search to discover the trade-offs in directly reducing the size of the relation, attribute, image, and graph embeddings. (Ben)
- `eva_graphencoder.ipynb`: Our experiments in using an autoencoder to reduce the size of the embeddings (Shreesh, Ben)
- `eva_effnet.ipynb`: Extracting the second-to-last layer activations of EfficientNet B0 and B7 to be used as image features in EVA. (Ben)
- `eva_altimgfeatures.ipynb`: An evaluation of the performance of alternative image features generated by EfficientNet B0 and B7 pre-trained on ImageNet. (Ben)
- `splitpkl.py`: A script to load the original image data (~20GiB pkl file) and split it into smaller pkl files that fit on low memory machines. (Ben)
- `rclone_sync.sh`: A utility script to sync this repository with google drive. (Ben)
